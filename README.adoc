This Spring application launches a server that handles requests to a table of
particles in a mysql database called my_database. Each particle has a name,
a mass (in MeV) and a electromagnetic charge. A particle can not be added to
the table if one with the same name already exist. The user (username db_user
and password db_password) can add and delete particles, as well as searching
for particles with a mass greater or less than a given value, or with a given
charge.

The adding particles can be done via a GET or a POST request (the POST request
only works with curl and postman, but not with Advanced REST client,
and I can not figure out why).
Deleting particles are done with DELETE requests and quering the database with
GET requests.

The Particle entities have the following fields

name - String
mass - double
charge - double

The following request are available:

POST:

  URI: /demo/post
  header: Content-Type:application/json
  raw data: {"name" : "name-of-particle", "mass" : mass, "charge" : charge}

DELETE

  URI: /demo/delete?name=name-of-particle

GET:

  URI: /demo/add?name=name-of-particle&mass=mass&charge=charge

  URI: /demo/all

  URI: /demo/findByName?name=name

  URI: /demo/findByMassGtr?mass=mass

  URI: /demo/findByMassLess?mass=mass

  URI: /demo/findByCharge?charge=charge

The application can be compiled with maven3 and includes some unit tests

Prior to running the application a database named my_database has to be created
and the user db_user, with password db_password needs to be given all rights
for this database.
